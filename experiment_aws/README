All experiments and tools for testing HWS (Heuristic Weighted Sampling)
It is sometimes refered to as AWS (Approximate Weighted Sampling) for legacy reasons


A list of files with a short description of their functions
----------------------------------------------------------

sampling_probabilities.R
> script for computing selection probability of samples for a range of sampling algorithms. 
> Functions are implemented several times to assure correctness:
    > simulation_*: very simple implementation, used since their correctness is easily checked, but very slow
    > log_* compute logaritmic probabilities to avoid problems with extremely small numbers that cannot be stored as standard double precision floating points
    > sampling_probability_{body, includes}.cpp, written in c++ for speedup

aws_vs_ws_experiment.R
> script to compute confidence interval on selection probability using WS and HWS sampling

distributionGeneration.R
> script to generate data distributions with certain sparsity and skew (uses solvers.R)

solvers.R
> a simulated annealing solver and a brute force solver

sampling_utils.R
> general utilities

weighted_linear_sampling.R
> attempt at implementing Weighted Linear Sampling by Motwani et al


aws_experiments.nb
> notebook to analyse heuristic of HWS, used to try to improve heuristic in HWS

bday_problem.nb
> Attempt at parametrizing upper and lower bounds of the weighted birthday problemm

JoinExperiments.nb
> Attempt at generating data in a natural way given sparsity and bias directly

log_mean.nb
> Efficient way to compute the mean of logarithms of numbers, without exponating them


aws_experiment_plots.ipynb
> tools to make plots
