Experiments for the complete system, sample-join + aggregation
Contains some symbolic links to files in experiment_aws that are required here.


A list of files with a short description of their functions
----------------------------------------------------------

compare_experiments.R
> Script to compare different strategies
> Supports different sample-join algorithms: US-join, WS-join, HWS-join
> Supports different aggregation techniques: uniform, stratified, weighted

custom_weighted_sum_join_body.cpp + naive_weighted_sum_join_includes.cpp
> fast US-join and WS-join implementation
> uniform, key-stratified and weighted aggregation functions (no range-strata yet)

joinsAndStrata.R
> utilities, including mini-join and stratification
